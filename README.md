# HR Data Analysis Project - Final Internship Project at DEPI

This repository contains the final project of my 6-month data analyst internship at DEPI. The project involves analyzing an HR dataset to uncover insights related to employee attrition, job satisfaction, and workforce demographics.

## Project Overview:
Our team, **ROMA** (Raslan, Omar, Mohammed, Ahmed), collaborated to complete the following tasks:
- **Data Cleaning**: Transforming raw HR data by mapping numerical values to meaningful labels (e.g., job satisfaction, performance rating, and work-life balance).
- **Data Analysis**: Conducting an in-depth analysis of employee attrition, performance, and satisfaction using Python.
- **Dashboards**: Creating insightful dashboards using Tableau to visualize key metrics such as attrition rates, monthly income vs. job satisfaction, and employee distribution by department and role.
- **Presentation**: Summarizing our findings and presenting them in a clear and concise manner.

## Key Dashboards:
1. **Employee Overview**: Visualizing employee counts, salary distribution, gender distribution, and job satisfaction levels.
2. **Employee Attrition & Performance**: Analyzing attrition rates by job role, work-life balance, and overtime.
3. **Workforce Demographics & Growth**: Examining tenure, training hours, promotion trends, and department-wise education distribution.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: For data cleaning and analysis.
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and dashboards.
- **Pandas & Matplotlib**: For additional data processing and visualizations.

## Team Members:
- **Mahmoud Raslan**: Dashboards, report writing, presentation creation.
- **Ahmed Alaa**: Data cleaning, insights in Python.
- **Omar Yasser**: Data cleaning, insights in Python.
- **Mohammed Sameh**: Dashboards, storytelling, blueprints.

Feel free to explore the code and Tableau dashboards for a deeper understanding of our analysis!
